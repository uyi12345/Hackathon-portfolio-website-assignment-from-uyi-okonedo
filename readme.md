This is the the link to the portfolio i created
https://v0-uyi-portfolio-creation-jyfkgo.vercel.app
i deployed it with vercel using html and css code

it contains About me,Resume,Skills,Contact form and Normal introduction.

However i encountered some challenges just deploying it with just my html and css code so vercel added some javascript file to deploy it.

However just the html and css code i uploaded in my github is enough to show my portfolio if deployed using one compiler.
